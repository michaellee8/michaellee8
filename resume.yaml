    summary: 
        In TFS, we were building a highly concurrent game system that 
        is expected to stream live video feed and then accept input to a 
        large amount of players. I am responsible for developing the 
        Golang-based microservices system.
    highlights:
      - Contributed to the initial proposal of the high concurrency 
        microservices architecture, using RabbitMQ as a message broker to 
        serve large amount of concurrent external connections, and gRPC for 
        internal low latency communication, with MySQL as database and Redis 
        as cache and secondary low latency database, mainly implemented with 
        Golang with additional Javascript libraries provided for frontend 
        consumption. Previous load testing indicates a concurrent peak 
        loading of at least 10K users when backed with message brokers and 
        databases with sufficient capacity.
      - Implementing of a low latency and highly efficient custom authentication 
        system for the RabbitMQ broker, backed by Redis.
      - Providing a rigidly tested, well structured system with reusable 
        modules to draw different graphs based on the current state of the system.
      - Implementing additional features and bugfixes on a MySQL-backed content 
        management system, across different services.
