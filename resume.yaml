    summary:  
        In TFS, we were building a highly concurrent game system that is 
        expected to stream live video feed and then accept input to a large 
        amount of players. I am responsible for developing the Golang-based 
        microservices system.
    highlights:
      - Contributed to the initial proposal of the high concurrency 
        microservices architecture, using RabbitMQ as a message broker to 
        serve large amount of concurrent external connections, and gRPC 
        for internal low latency communication, with MySQL as database and 
        Redis as cache and secondary low latency database, mainly implemented 
        with Golang with additional Javascript libraries provided for frontend 
        consumption. Previous load testing indicates a concurrent peak loading 
        of at least 10K users when backed with message brokers and databases 
        with sufficient capacity.
      - Implement a low latency and highly efficient custom authentication 
        system for the RabbitMQ broker, backed by Redis.
      - Provide a rigidly tested, well structured system with reusable modules 
        to draw different graphs based on the current state of the system.
      - Implement additional features and bugfixes on a MySQL-backed content 
        management system, across different services.
