    location: Singapore (Remote)
    description: Simple self-custodial auth infra for Web3 apps and wallets
    position: Software Engineer
    url: https://web3auth.io/
    startDate: "2021-08"
    summary: Web3Auth is a distributed private key management solution. By abstracting the management of private keys away from the end user, we allow users to start making use of blockchain applications using familiar authentication methods like Google or Facebook login. Our goal is to allow any digital identity to be a valid cross-platform identifier, allowing users to bring their digital identities with them to any application on the Internet.
    highlights:
      - Developmemnt of full suite of mobile SDKs on Android. iOS, Flutter and React Native, for Web3Auth and CustomAuth.
        From never touched native mobile development to developing across the whole mobile stack in 10 months.
      - Developer relation and support from client developers for integrating our SDKs, troubleshooting across the full stack,
        from blockchain nodes written in Go, backenc services written in Node.js, frontend webapps written in Vue.js and React.js,
        to mobile SDK written on the aforementioned languages.
      - Created the [react-native-web-browser](https://github.com/torusresearch/react-native-web-browser) package,
        which allows the same API to be used for opening browser sessions in both Expo and bare React Native apps.
        Reducing React Native related support requests by at least 50%.

    position: Junior Software Analyst
    url: https://tfs-grp.com/
    startDate: "2019-08"
    endDate: "2021-06"
    summary: In TFS, we were building a highly concurrent game system that
      is expected to stream live video feed and then accept input to a
      large amount of players. I am responsible for developing the
      Golang-based microservices system.
    highlights:
      - Contributed to the initial proposal of the high concurrency
        microservices architecture, using RabbitMQ as a message broker to
        serve a large amount of concurrent external connections, and gRPC for
        internal low latency communication, with MySQL as database and Redis
        as cache and secondary low latency database, mainly implemented with
        Golang with additional Javascript libraries provided for frontend
        consumption. Previous load testing indicates a concurrent peak
        loading of at least 10K users when backed with message brokers and
        databases with sufficient capacity.
      - Implementing of a low latency and highly efficient custom authentication
        system for the RabbitMQ broker, backed by Redis.
      - Providing a rigidly tested, well-structured system with reusable
        modules to draw different graphs based on the current state of the system.
      - Implementing additional features and bugfixes on a MySQL-backed content
        management system, across different services.
