I am a self-taught Software Engineer from [Hong Kong][2]. Previously worked in Remote [Golang][3] backend engineering roles and [React Native][5] frontend roles. Loves coding in **[Golang][3]** and **[Flutter][4]**. Currently studying Computer Engineering in the [University of Hong Kong][6]. Daily linux/tmux/neovim/gcp user. 

I would describe myself as a technical focused **problem-solver** who prioritize **quality** over quentity. I have a passion to solve hard technical obstacles that others would have gave up, both obstacles from work and from open-source projects that I often work with. I also value taking extra time to submit carefully structured and tested bug-free code rather than submitting buggy non-maintainble code to shorten development time. I always believe that quality code would boost productivity hence quantity in the long term. 

Please have a look at my resume at https://resume.michaellee8.com/ on my work experiences and skill sets. Also please feel free to pay a visit to my website at https://michaellee8.com.

## Some of my recent personal projects:

- [flutter_blue_beacon][7]: An Flutter library to implement iBeacon and Eddystone scanning on top of `flutter_blue`.
- [fluuter_fuchsia_toolchain][8]: A set of scripts to allow easier development of Flutter apps in Google's Fuchsia OS.
- [pubenvconfig][9]: My daily working environment setup, populated with a set of configs and scripts for tools that I use frequently, like Neovim and Tmux. You can see my setup for developing Flutter apps **on** (not for) Android devices [here][11].
- [clui-nix][10]: A WIP experiment to implement a graphical CLUI (Command Line User Interface) for *nix enviroment. Currently working on a prototype that includes `zsh` provider, terminal ui and websocket consumer, and a Flutter-based frontend client. 

## Some of my recent open-source contributions/participations:

- [Flutter][12]: Previously contributed to Flutter's [tooling][14] [on][15] Fuchsia. Currently participating in the [discussion][13] and doing some small experiments on enabling Hot Reload under Flutter Web. 
- [vifm][16]: Contributed an AppImage generation [script][17].

- For recruiters: Please kindly PM me via [LinkedIn][18]
- General contact: Email address is not put here to prevent spammers, but it should be easy to retrieve if you know how to use [GitHub API][19]

## Fun facts

- I love eating tasty food, but meanwhile I am unable to eat most of them since I am suffering from allergies.

- I embrace open source and open ecosystem hence I always uses an Android phone, and I more or less dislike Apple for their closed ecosystem. However I still had to buy a cheap iPad for developing iOS apps and I am running a OSX-KVM instance on my Ubuntu Laptop for the same reason. I also exchanged my girlfriend's old AirPods with a new AirPods pro since AirPod was the only decent earbuds on the market that won't make my ear itchy. 

- I started programming about 10 years ago when I borrowed a very outdated Visual Basic 6.0 book from a local library. My first project was a "Michael Explorer" that embeds IE 7 with a few buttons for navigation. I actually got my first job at a learning product company that provides my Secondary school's e-Learning platform by discovering multiple security flaws in the platform (and fixed all of them after joining the company). 

- I doesn't really like studying in Academica so I spend most of my effort in actually software engineering work and open source contributions, and didn't ~~waste~~ invest much time in studying during my University and Secondary school time. I am litaerlly paying about 20K USD to get a piece of paper with the word certificate on it. Still I got quite a good result in my secondary school public exam and it grants me to a Bachelor of Engineering entry in HKU which has a QS ranking like 20-30.

## I am currently job seeking!

I maybe the engineer you are looking for if you re finding someone who: 

- **Takes software engineering seriously**, not just care about whether that feature works, but also care about whether that feature has been implemented correctly and cleanly. 

- Cares about **long term productivity** by embracing **clean code structure**, **code review** and **testing**, rather than short term productivity by submitting code that barely works. 

- **Passionate** about software engineering, loves to read source code on open source projects and then **contribute** actual code to them instead of filing feature requests. 

- **A fast learner with a T-shape skillset**. I am more specialized in **Flutter** and **Golang** but I knows a bit of pretty much all those "popular" technologies. I have previously worked in development roles that involves **React.js**, **React Native**, **PHP**, **Node.js**, **MySQL**, **Redis**, **RabbitMQ**, **Kubernetes** and **AWS**. I am a daily user of **Ubuntu Linux** and I mostly develop backend applications in **GCP** VM instance running a combination of **tmux** and **neovim**. I have also learnt a bit of **C/C++** and **Python**. 

I believe job seeking is mutual so I am also looking for comapny that: 

- Offers a **Remote** Engineering role that allows something living in **GMT+8** (Hong Kong). I am looking forward to move to Canada or United States in after two or three years but currently I am unable to do so. 

- Practices a **proper software development process**, which you expect engineers to write well structured code, and you embrace code review and testing. You have a well-formed healthy codebase that doesn't put global declarations everywhere. Preferrably you open-source some of your code or even running on an **open-source business model**.

- Offers a **in-depth technical** engineering role rather than CRUD development ones. I like engineering **challenges** and I am the kind of people who likes to pick up the problems that my collages faces and then work on them, but then it also means that I doesn't really like those boring code gluing copy and paste tasks that should have been automated via some code generation tools instead of done by bare hands, so I hope that you will offer me challenges instead of mechanic tasks.

- Understands the "myth of man month" and "tech debt", hence **values long-term productivity** over short-term output. Some management doesn't understand why would their development team just stop typing code and spend time doing those code architecture planning, code reviews and tests, when adding a HTML button and adding and changing "a few lines" in the backend codebase would have "apparently" done the job. I hope that you would be the kind of company who would invest `2t` of time for developing code with a **proper development process** so you only got 1 bugfix that would cost you `0.3t` of time later, so it totally takes you `2.3t`, rather than pushing engineers to develop features with `0.8t` and then got 5 bugfixes that each one takes you `0.7t`, so it takes you a total of `4.3t`. You **priortize code quality over quantity.**

- Has a **flexible** workplace culture and judges by value created. I am not really in favour of micro-management and ceratainly won't be sitting in front of a webcam 8 hours per day. I hope that you will be allowing me to work when I am feeling energized so that I can produce the most value for you. I also hope that you will be judging my performance by value I have created for you rather than time I have spent or lines of code I have written.
