## Hi there from Michael Lee, alias [michaellee8][1] ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught Software Engineer from [Hong Kong][2]. Previously worked in Remote [Golang][3] backend engineering roles and [React Native][5] frontend roles. Loves coding in **[Golang][3]** and **[Flutter][4]**. Currently studying Computer Engineering in the [University of Hong Kong][6]. Daily linux/tmux/neovim/gcp user. 

I would describe myself as a technical focused **problem-solver** who prioritize **quality** over quentity. I have a passion to solve hard technical obstacles that others would have gave up, both obstacles from work and from open-source projects that I often work with. I also value taking extra time to submit carefully structured and tested bug-free code rather than submitting buggy non-maintainble code to shorten development time. I always believe that quality code would boost productivity hence quantity in the long term. 

Please have a look at my resume at https://resume.michaellee8.com/ on my work experiences and skill sets. Also please feel free to pay a visit to my website at https://michaellee8.com.

## Some of my recent personal projects:

- [flutter_blue_beacon][7]: An Flutter library to implement iBeacon and Eddystone scanning on top of `flutter_blue`.
- [fluuter_fuchsia_toolchain][8]: A set of scripts to allow easier development of Flutter apps in Google's Fuchsia OS.
- [pubenvconfig][9]: My daily working environment setup, populated with a set of configs and scripts for tools that I use frequently, like Neovim and Tmux. You can see my setup for developing Flutter apps **on** (not for) Android devices [here][11].
- [clui-nix][10]: A WIP experiment to implement a graphical CLUI (Command Line User Interface) for *nix enviroment. Currently working on a prototype that includes `zsh` provider, terminal ui and websocket consumer, and a Flutter-based frontend client. 

## Some of my recent open-source contributions/participations:

- [Flutter][12]: Previously contributed to Flutter's [tooling][14] [on][15] Fuchsia. Currently participating in the [discussion][13] and doing some small experiments on enabling Hot Reload under Flutter Web. 
- [vifm][16]: Contributed an AppImage generation [script][17].

- For recruiters: Please kindly PM me via [LinkedIn][18]
- General contact: Email address is not put here to prevent spammers, but it should be easy to retrieve if you know how to use [GitHub API][19]

## Fun facts

- I love eating tasty food, but meanwhile I am unable to eat most of them since I am suffering from allergies.

- I embrace open source and open ecosystem hence I always uses an Android phone, and I more or less dislike Apple for their closed ecosystem. However I still had to buy a cheap iPad for developing iOS apps and I am running a OSX-KVM instance on my Ubuntu Laptop for the same reason. I also exchanged my girlfriend's old AirPods with a new AirPods pro since AirPod was the only decent earbuds on the market that won't make my ear itchy. 

- I started programming about 10 years ago when I borrowed a very outdated Visual Basic 6.0 book from a local library. My first project was a "Michael Explorer" that embeds IE 7 with a few buttons for navigation. I actually got my first job at a learning product company that provides my Secondary school's e-Learning platform by discovering multiple security flaws in the platform (and fixed all of them after joining the company).

## I am currently job seeking!

I maybe the engineer you are looking for if you re finding someone who: 

- Takes software engineering seriously, not just care about whether that feature works, but also care about whether that feature has been implemented correctly and cleanly. 

- Cares about long term productivity by embracing clean code structure, code review and testing, whether than short term productivity by submitting code that barely works. 

- Passionate about software engineering, loves to read source code on open source projects and then contribute actual code to them
