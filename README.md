### Hi there from Michael Lee, alias [michaellee8][1] ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught Software Engineer from [Hong Kong][2]. Previously worked in Remote [Golang][3] backend engineering roles and [React Native][5] frontend roles. Loves coding in **[Golang][3]** and **[Flutter][4]**. Currently studying Computer Engineering in the [University of Hong Kong][6]. Daily linux/tmux/neovim/gcp user. 

I would describe myself as a technical focused **problem-solver** who prioritize **quality** over quentity. I have a passion to solve hard technical obstacles that others would have gave up, both obstacles from work and from open-source projects that I often work with. I also value taking extra time to submit carefully structured and tested bug-free code rather than submitting buggy non-maintainble code to shorten development time. I always believe that quality code would boost productivity hence quantity in the long term. 

Please have a look at my resume at https://resume.michaellee8.com/ on my work experiences and skill sets.

### Some of my recent personal projects:

- [flutter_blue_beacon][7]: An Flutter library to implement iBeacon and Eddystone scanning on top of `flutter_blue`.
- [fluuter_fuchsia_toolchain][8]: A set of scripts to allow easier development of Flutter apps in Google's Fuchsia OS.
- [pubenvconfig][9]: My daily working environment setup, populated with a set of configs and scripts for tools that I use frequently, like Neovim and Tmux. You can see my setup for developing Flutter apps **on** (not for) Android devices [here][11].
- [clui-nix][10]: A WIP experiment to implement a graphical CLUI (Command Line User Interface) for *nix enviroment. Currently working on a prototype that includes `zsh` provider, terminal ui and websocket consumer, and a Flutter-based frontend client. 

### Some of my open-source contributions/participations:

- [Flutter][12]: Previously contributed to Flutter's [tooling][14] [on][15] Fuchsia. Currently participating in the [discussion][13] and doing some small experiments on enabling Hot Reload under Flutter Web. 
- [vifm][16]: Contributed to an AppImage generation [script][17].
